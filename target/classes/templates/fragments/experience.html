                        <p class="timeline-description">As a third-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at BIT Mesra, I’ve been actively exploring software development alongside my core engineering studies. With a strong interest in backend technologies, I’ve been learning Java and Spring Boot, and applying these skills through projects inspired by domains like healthcare, retail, and technology. Academic courses and hands-on work have helped me understand how scalable systems are built, while also developing my teamwork and problem-solving abilities through Agile-style collaboration. I’m continuously working to bridge my EEE background with software, aiming to build impactful and efficient solutions.

                            During my time at DPS Ranchi, I actively participated in academic and extracurricular activities that helped me grow both personally and academically. I took initiative in creating educational content to support fellow students—whether it was simplifying school subjects, offering study tips, or sharing guidance on exams and career planning. Through platforms like YouTube and social media, I was able to reach and support a wide group of students, building a small but engaged learning community.                 </div>
